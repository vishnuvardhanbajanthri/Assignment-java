Java Thread start() method:

The start() method of thread class is used to begin the execution of thread. The result of this method is two threads that are running concurrently: the current thread (which returns from the call to the start method) and the other thread (which executes its run method).
The start() method internally calls the run() method of Runnable interface to execute the code specified in the run() method in a separate thread.

The start thread performs the following tasks:

It stats a new thread
The thread moves from New State to Runnable state.
When the thread gets a chance to execute, its target run() method will run.

Syntax:
public void start()  

Return value
It does not return any value.
  
Exception
IllegalThreadStateException - This exception throws if the start() method is called more than one times.

For ex.
public class StartExp1 extends Thread  
{    
    public void run()  
    {    
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");    
    }    
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {    
        StartExp1 t1=new StartExp1();    
        // this will call run() method  
        t1.start();    
    }    
}
