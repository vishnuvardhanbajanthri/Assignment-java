Java Thread Priority in Multithreading:

Thread Priority is a concept where each thread is having a priority which in laymanâ€™s language one can say every object is having priority here which is represented by numbers ranging from 1 to 10.
The default priority is set to 5 as excepted.
Minimum priority is set to 1.
Maximum priority is set to 10.
Here 3 constants are defined in it namely as follows:

1.public static int NORM_PRIORITY
2.public static int MIN_PRIORITY
3.public static int MAX_PRIORITY

public final int getPriority():
 java.lang.Thread.getPriority() method returns priority of given thread.
public final void setPriority(int newPriority): 
java.lang.Thread.setPriority() method changes the priority of thread to the value newPriority. 
This method throws IllegalArgumentException if value of parameter newPriority goes beyond minimum(1) and maximum(10) limit.
